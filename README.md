#Chrome Extensions


Container repo for housing miscellaneous chrome extensions I'm experimenting with.

##Double Trouble

Detects multiple edit sessions of a single confluence page

I don't know what the deal is, but I keep running into the scenario where I'm editting a page, get busy with some interrupt then come back to working on my page in another chrome tab or window, and totally forget about the original page until I submit.  At that point I have to merge and there's always the unsettling feeling that some edit is being lost.  

This extension detects this scenario and pops up a suitably obnoxious modal alert warning window when I click edit. 

### Bugs
Currently doesn't detect if you copy a URL of a concluence page in edit, and paste it in another tab.
